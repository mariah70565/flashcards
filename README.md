# Web Development Project 2 - flashcards

Submitted by: Mariah Gonzales

This web app: provides a set of 11 flashcards - 10 that are each displayed in a random order when a user clicks the "next arrow" button. The user is first shown a pre-flashcard that guides the user on how to use the program. Every flashcard shows the question side first. When the flashcard is clicked, the flashcard then shows the answer side. Each card corresponds to a Snoopy theme to test the knowledge of the user with fun facts about the PEANUTS character!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was unable to figure out how to do a flip animation for my cards, so I decided to just change the animation such that the cards increase in size slighly when hovered over, and again when clicked on.
